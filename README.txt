An implemetation that uses geotools quickstart [1], to analyse GPS data.

Delaunay Triangulation [4]
- Along with this tool, Java implementation of S-hull algorithm [4] for finding the Delaunay triangulation of a point set is available.

Gaberiel Graph [6]
- Gabriel Graph is constructed using the Delaunay triangulation as the input.
